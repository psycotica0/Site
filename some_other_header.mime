Title: Some Other Header?

So, basically right now I'm trying to come up with a theme of sorts. It is intended to be very minimal and liney.

So far it looks like I've done a fairly good job of that.

Truth be told I'm quite surprised at how it turned out. 
Typically I'll see something in my head or whatever but am incapable of moving it to the outside world.
In this case, though it worked pretty well.
I like it.
